	- Svelte
- Backend 📖
	- Golang
	- NodeJs
- Devops ⚙️

## Pet project plans 🛠:
- Anxiety Generator 🫠
	Just a timer showing the time until #{something} happens, in a very unpleasant format. In a very truthful format
	My plan is to make people appreciate their lives more.
-  AI Personal Trainer 🏋️
	First, I want to work with the api of any AIs. 
	Secondly, one of my hobbies is gym, so everyone I know thinks it is possible to refer to a nutrition and workout plan. Not that I am against it, just would like to automate this process
